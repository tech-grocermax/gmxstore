# gmxstore

The gmxstore runs within uwsgi (via supervisor) and can be served
from any WSGI-compatible web server, e.g. nginx or apache2.


## nginx (standalone)

The gmxstore ships with a suitable nginx configuration for  
deployment by itself, within the /etc/nginx/sites-available directory. 
By default, this configuration is *NOT* enabled, but you can easily 
enable it by:

 1. Link gmxstore into sites-enabled:

    $ ln -s ../sites-available/gmxstore /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/

 2. Disable the default nginx configuration (if any):

    $ rm -f /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default

 3. Reload the nginx configuration:

    $ service nginx restart


Again, for easy copy-pasting:

    ln -s ../sites-available/gmxstore /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
    rm -f /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default
    service nginx restart


Note that because the package install does not enable this configuration,
package removal *WILL NOT* remove this configuration. Fortunately,
reverting the above steps is as easy as:

    ln -s ../sites-available/default /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
    rm -f /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/gmxstore
    service nginx restart


# nginx (multiple applications)

The default nginx configuration defines a complete server and 
routes "/" to the gmxstore application. 

If you want to host multiple applications from the same nginx 
server, you will need to define a customized configuration 
that defines routes for all applications, probably with a 
rewrite rule so that each application believes it is managing
the root path.
